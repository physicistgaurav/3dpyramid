3D Pyramid
A pyramid is a 3D polyhedron with the base of a polygon along with three or more triangle-shaped faces that meet at a point above the base. The triangular sides are called faces and the point above the base is called the apex. A pyramid is made by connecting the base to the apex. Sometimes, the triangular sides are also called lateral faces to distinguish them from the base. In a pyramid, each edge of the base is connected to the apex that forms the triangular face.


As a part of the mini-project, I decided to work on this 3d pyramid. In this mini-project 3D Pyramid was visually presented in the output, which was a continually rotating pyramid. Also, the basic functionalities like its rotation speed(i.e velocity), position, and state were implemented which could be given tingled as per the user.The implemented pyramid is shown in the image below.
